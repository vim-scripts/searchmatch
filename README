So if you're a frequent user of Vim's hlsearch feature, you may find yourself wishing that you could highlight multiple searches. Well Vim has support for this in its :match command, but doesn't make that particularly easy to use.

This plugin aims to put the full power of Vim's :match feature at the user's fingertips in the easiest way possible: as an extension of the existing search feature that you know and love.

You just search for something, and then pin that search with one of the SearchMatchN commands or key mappings.
